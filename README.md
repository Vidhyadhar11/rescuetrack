# Rescue Track


An application under which all rescue agencies are registered and which can display
The location of other rescue relief agencies during natural/ man made calamities

## The Idea

This Innovation deals with providing real time GIS information and location data of
various rescue teams on a easy to use map We'll be providing a way to seamlessly coordinate over large distances much more efficiently.

## Approach

Our approach is a well integrated and easy to
use system for organizations dealing with
disaster management.

## Scope of Service

Our software solution
will be implemented to serve the needs of
government organisations or non profits
dealing with search and rescure operations
during disasters.

## Possible Bottlenecks

We are making it to be mostly
independent , but our use of FIREBASE for
cloud integration and the use googles
mapping services to be integrated with
our platform serves as our bottleneck
dependencies.
